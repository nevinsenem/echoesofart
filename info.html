    <h3>About the Location</h3>
    <p>Kadir Has University is located in the historic Cibali district, offering a rich blend of modern education and cultural heritage. The university's campus provides a unique environment for learning, creativity, and inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kadir Has University was founded on the old tobacco factory built during the Ottoman period. The factory operated until the 1980s. In 1992, this factory was purchased by the Rezan Has Foundation and after 5 years of restoration, maintenance and updating, the university started its education life in 1997. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The restoration process preserved much of the site's historical value, transforming it into a vibrant academic and cultural hub. Today, the campus is not only an educational institution but also a testament to the successful blend of historical preservation and modern architecture.


      </p>
      <p>
        Located near the Golden Horn, the university offers breathtaking views and easy access to Istanbul's rich cultural landmarks, such as the Galata Tower, Suleymaniye Mosque, and the vibrant streets of Balat. Students and visitors can immerse themselves in a unique environment that bridges the past and the future.
